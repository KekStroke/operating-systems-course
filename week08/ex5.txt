Difference between a physical and a virtual address.

Physical address is precise location of data in a hardware device's memory.

Virtual address maps all physcial addresses together even if they are on stored on different devices.
It is used as an abstraction for CPU and programmers so that they would not be conserned on where exactly put what data.
Thus, virtual address serves as a reference to some real memory.

While the application is running, the CPU generates virtual addresses that are mapped to physical addresses by MMU.
