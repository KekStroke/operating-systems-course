ex3.c implements the round robin approach. The algorithm gives each available process the same time period or quantum to run. If a process's burst time exceeds the quantum, it is terminated while it is still running and another process that is available is given the time slot. In contrast to the other methods, round robin is a preemptive technique since the scheduler removes the process off the CPU once the time restriction has passed.
